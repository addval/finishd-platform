## 🎯 How Skills Work

### Automatic Activation
Claude automatically activates skills based on your request context. You don't need to manually invoke them.

### Skill Context
Each skill has:
- **Clear description** - Claude knows when to use it
- **Allowed tools** - Specific permissions for safe execution
- **Progressive disclosure** - Essential info in SKILL.md, details in supporting files
- **Utility scripts** - Automated generators for common tasks

### Best Practices

**DO's**:
- ✅ Be specific in your requests
- ✅ Provide context about what you're building
- ✅ Reference existing code when making changes
- ✅ Ask for explanations if needed
- ✅ Test generated code before committing

**DON'Ts**:
- ❌ Run migrations without reviewing them first
- ❌ Commit sensitive data
- ❌ Skip testing generated code
- ❌ Make breaking changes without understanding impact

## 🔧 Quick Start Examples

### Backend Development
```
> Create a REST API for blog posts with CRUD operations
> Add authentication middleware to protected routes
> Generate a Sequelize model for users with email validation
```

### Frontend Development
```
> Create a PostCard component with like functionality
> Build a custom useFetch hook with error handling
> Implement a context provider for user authentication
```

### Database
```
> Create a migration for posts table with author foreign key
> Add a many-to-many relationship between posts and tags
> Generate a seeder for initial users data
```

### Testing
```
> Write unit tests for UserService with Vitest
> Create integration tests for the login endpoint
> Add tests for a React component using React Testing Library
```

### Git Workflow
```
> Create a commit message for fixing login bug
> Generate a PR description for the new feature branch
> Create a feature branch for user registration
```
